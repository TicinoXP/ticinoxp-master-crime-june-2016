# Master Crime

Master Crime is a game which mixes Clue with Mastermind: a crime has been
committed and you have to frame the murderer; in order to do it, you
have to guess the perpetrator, the victim, the motive, the murder weapon
and the crime scene; each time you fail, the system tells you how many
parameters you guessed right but what exaclty you missed; the games goes
on until your guess satifies all the parameters.
